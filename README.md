# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
